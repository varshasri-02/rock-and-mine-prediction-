Project Overview
In this project, the goal is to classify objects into two categories: rock or mine. The data consists of features that represent various characteristics of the objects. Logistic Regression is used to train the model and predict the type of object based on these features.

Dataset
The dataset contains 208 instances and 61 features (60 input features and 1 output label). The labels indicate whether the object is a rock or a mine:

M: Mine
R: Rock
Libraries Used
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For visualizations.
seaborn: For advanced visualizations.
sklearn: For implementing machine learning models (Logistic Regression) and evaluating the model.
Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:

Loading the dataset.
Encoding the target labels ("M" for mine and "R" for rock) using label encoding.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Feature scaling to standardize the input features using StandardScaler.
Model Training
The model is trained using Logistic Regression for binary classification. The classifier is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.

Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:

Accuracy: Measures how well the model performs overall.
Confusion Matrix: Shows the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative results.
Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for a detailed evaluation of the classifier's performance.
